Pierc-postgresql is a python bot that logs IRC channels, and a PHP/JS interface for browsing said logs.

This project was forked from Curtis Lassam's pierc and adapted to work with a postgresql database backend.

Installation instructions can be found at http://p2j.github.io/pierc-postgresql/ .
Installation instructions for python-psycopg2 can be found at http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html .

It depends on python-psycopg2, which is ~LGPL, and Joel Rosdahl's IRC Bot library,
which is ~GPLv2 - so Pierc-postgresql, too, is GPLv2.
